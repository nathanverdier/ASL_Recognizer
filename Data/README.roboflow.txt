The dataset includes 23343 images.
Hand-signs are annotated in Multi-Class Classification format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.5 pixels
