# ASL Recognizer

ASL_Recognizer is a small AI project designed to enable real-time detection of American Sign Language (ASL) gestures with transcription into text. This project utilizes deep learning techniques to recognize hand gestures from images and transcribe them into corresponding text.

## Dataset

We utilize the American Sign Language dataset available at Roboflow. This dataset contains a diverse range of ASL gestures captured in various environments and lighting conditions.
Here is the link to the original dataset: [click here](https://universe.roboflow.com/majorproject-25tao/american-sign-language-v36cz/health)

## Technologies Used

* Keras: We use Keras, a high-level neural networks API, for building and training our deep learning models. Keras provides a user-friendly interface for constructing complex neural networks efficiently.
* JAX: JAX is a numerical computing library that offers high-performance and automatic differentiation for machine learning algorithms. We leverage JAX to optimize our model training process and improve computational efficiency.


## How to use

As the project is not over yet, there is currently no way to launch the project.

Therefore, you can test our project with the collab link [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xUI6seNgZghrLQ2ysyKziGf3GnerlOqV#scrollTo=nAI0A9pWc3ub)

If you want to use the code outside of the collab file, you can install the required libraries easily with the `requierements.txt` file.

Run :
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
